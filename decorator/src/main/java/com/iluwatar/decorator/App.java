/**
 * The Decorator pattern is a more flexible alternative to subclassing. The Decorator class
 * implements the same interface as the target and uses composition to "decorate" calls to the
 * target. Using the Decorator pattern it is possible to change the behavior of the class during
 * runtime.
 *
 * <p>In this example we show how the simple {@link SimpleTroll} first attacks and then flees the
 * battle. Then we decorate the {@link SimpleTroll} with a {@link ClubbedTroll} and perform the
 * attack again. You can see how the behavior changes after the decoration.
 *
 * 装饰器模式是比子类化更灵活的替代方案。装饰器类实现与目标相同的接口，并使用组合来“装饰”对目标的调用。使用装饰器模式，可以在运行时更改类的行为。
 * <p>在这个例子中，我们展示了简单的 {@link SimpleTroll} 如何先攻击然后逃离战斗。
 * 然后我们用 {@link ClubbedTroll} 装饰 {@link SimpleTroll} 并再次执行攻击。你可以看到装饰后的行为变化。
